        <p>We begin with an introductory in-home consultation, to immerse ourselves in your world and have an in-depth discussion to uncover and understand your ideas, aspirations and expectations. We’ll personally survey the space/s and discuss timeframes and budgets. From this meeting we’ll provide an itemised proposal and cost estimate for your review and approval.</p>
